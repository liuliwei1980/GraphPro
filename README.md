we introduce a novel interpretable model based on graph neural networks, named GraphPro, for multi-species promoter identification. 

# Requirements
python                    3.8.10
numpy                     1.22.4   
pandas                    2.0.3 
scikit-learn              1.3.0    
torch                     1.11.0+cu113 
torchvision               0.12.0+cu113  
# Usage
Simple operation: 
The data is in the Datasets folder, and you can operate according to the following requirements:

1. First, fill in the name of the data set to be predicted in pairs.py (please fill in the folder name, such as Bamy), run pairs.py, and generate the corresponding structure file "pair.npy" in the data set folder.

2. Fill in the name of the data set to be predicted in wTest2.py, and run wTest2.py, and the results will be saved in the corresponding data set.
Thank you and enjoy the tool!
